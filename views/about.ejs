    <p class="description"> My process starts with an indescribable sensation, with a color I don’t necessarily prefer- usually with something I tend to deny. Inspiration comes from my emotional landscape and the way it does not fit to the surrounding circumstances. With no end in my mind, I let colors of the soul and thought shapes to transform into new forms and textures.</p>

    <p class="description">Layer after layer, I become less and less attached to the object. What interests me is the constant process of wondering, a drop-down-through my unconscious abyss and bringing to the surface what I don’t know I know about myself. By surrendering to this journey, I intuitively understand what comes next in the instant pictures that cultivate my inner knowing.</p>
